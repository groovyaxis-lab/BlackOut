# Blackout
An addon for Meteor client that adds a variety of new/improved features to the Meteor client
such as a new and improved CrystalAura, BedAura and PacketFly and a lot more of new things to push you above the competition.

The development of the addon might not be super active due to us having our own lives contrary to the popular belief.
